I have written a small page to demonstrate service workers and cache. The intent is to cache the 'helloWorld.html' file to demonstrate offline functionality. Further testing is needed.

I have set up an Django application to handle the remote database in the future, I am considering using DynamoDB to do this. I will further explore this once I learn more about OSM data and how to store it.

I have begun experimenting and for now believe that using IndexedDB is more suitable to Web Storage as it offers a better (and much needed) scalability. Further testing is needed to reach a conclusion on which technology to use. Lastly, a bug in which service workers were not being registered has been fixed.

While IndexedDB involved a more significant learning curve, I have decided to go forward with IndexedDB as scalability is necessary. I have also made a basic page that allows users to draw shapes using HTML5 canvas. I am considering using Mapbox for processing and displaying OSM data, further experimentation is needed to decide which API is appropiate for the project's requirements.

The canvas page works as intended. Next up I will make a simple page to display OSM data and explore possible forms of remote database storage, processing, and local storage of such data.
