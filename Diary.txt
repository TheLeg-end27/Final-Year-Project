I have set up an Django application to handle the remote database in the future, I am considering using DynamoDB to do this. I will further explore this once I learn more about OSM data and how to store it.

I have begun experimenting and for now believe that using IndexedDB is more suitable to Web Storage as it offers a better (and much needed) scalability. Further testing is needed to reach a conclusion on which technology to use. Lastly, a bug in which service workers were not being registered has been fixed.
