I have written a small page to demonstrate service workers and cache. The intent is to cache the 'helloWorld.html' file to demonstrate offline functionality. Further testing is needed.

I have set up an Django application to handle the remote database in the future, I am considering using DynamoDB to do this. I will further explore this once I learn more about OSM data and how to store it.

I have begun experimenting and for now believe that using IndexedDB is more suitable to Web Storage as it offers a better (and much needed) scalability. Further testing is needed to reach a conclusion on which technology to use. Lastly, a bug in which service workers were not being registered has been fixed.

While IndexedDB involved a more significant learning curve, I have decided to go forward with IndexedDB as scalability is necessary. I have also made a basic page that allows users to draw shapes using HTML5 canvas. I am considering using Mapbox for processing and displaying OSM data, further experimentation is needed to decide which API is appropiate for the project's requirements.

The canvas page works as intended. Next up I will make a simple page to display OSM data and explore possible forms of remote database storage, processing, and local storage of such data.

This page allows an .osm file to be uploaded and its contents displayed as elements (nodes) in a list. The sample used was OSM data of Antartica. The next challenge will be to turn such data into a map, how to store this data in a remote database, and how to make it lightweight for the client to render. I will be experimenting with Mapbox to achieve this.

Now that the page to display the contents of an .osm file works correctly. I will continue investigating Mapbox and possible integration with a remote and local database. So far the most notable candidates are MongoDB and DynamoDB for remote database and noSQL (as part of IndexedDB) for local database.
